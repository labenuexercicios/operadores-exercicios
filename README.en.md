- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<class-firstname-lastname-a008>`.
   <details>
      <summary>Understand the `git checkout -b` command</summary>
      <p>In class you learned how to create a branch (`git branch "branch-name"`) and move to it (`git checkout "branch-name"`). However, git allows you to use contractions to do more of the action with a single command, which is the case with (`git checkout -b "branch-name"`), which creates and automatically moves to the newly created branch.</ p>
   </details>
- [ ] Deploy the project to the `<class-firstname-lastname-a008>` branch. Remember to make commits.
- [ ] Push the commits: git push origin `<class-firstname-lastname-a008>`.

**Follow the steps below when finishing your project, to submit it:**

- [ ] Send a Pull Request from your newly pushed branch, so you can merge it later. **PLEASE DO NOT MERGE YOUR OWN PULL REQUEST**
- [ ] After the feedback and correction moment, approve your Pull Request and merge it
- [ ] Your project will be considered complete when approval and merge with main happen **in your own repository**.

### How am I going to perform the exercises?
Each of the folders has a .html file, which is linked to the .js file that you will use to do the exercise. The exercise code should be written in the .js file, and you should see the result by accessing the .html file in your internet browser (we suggest Google Chrome), and opening the DevTools Console tab. To access the file, you can copy its path and paste it in the browser, or use the LiveServer extension. More details about the extension in the asynchronous stuff.

### What do you need to know and practice from this class?

- [ ] item 1 - **arithmetic** operators
- [ ] item 2 - **relational** operators
- [ ] item 3 - **logical** operators

Each folder in this repo has a README.md with the exercise statement and a template to get you started.
